						<h3>Italy Life:</h3>
						<p style='color: blueviolet;'>Kobe Bryant had a very unique childhood. His father was a professional basketball player himself, which means that Kobe's family would have to relocate frequently. One of these 
							relocations was to Italy where a young Kobe faced a severe culture shock. By not knowing the language or having stable friendships, Kobe would confide in the game of basketball 
							and develop a sense of independency that would serve him for years to come.

						<h3>Philly Life:</h3>
						<p style='color:blueviolet;'>The last relocation that Kobe had to experience before his NBA career was when he was thirteen and his family moved back to Philadelphia. This where he faced more culture shock as a
						teenager. He got through this phase yet again by keeping his focus on basketball, which ultimately let to him emerging as one of the best high school players in the country. The following video offers some perspective
						about how his experiences throughout his upbringing helped him develop internal strength and maturity as he was transitioning into adult life.

						<h3>Early NBA life:</h3>
						<p style='color: blueviolet;'>After being drafted 13th overall straight out of Lower Merion High School, Kobe's path was set in stone to be a solitary one. Before the 2000s, it was very rare for a player to be drafted straight out of high school. That being said, Kobe was on a team full of
						much older players and yet again, felt out of place amongst. Also, he realized that many players don't share his level of commitment to the game, which strayed him further apart from being very social with his peers. The pattern of basketball being his one true friend was destined to continue.

						<h3>Difficult Rookie and Sophmore Seasons:</h3>
						<p style='color: blueviolet;'>Despite being very committed to the team and game, Kobe's youth resulted in his coaches being hesitant to give him consistent opportunities. This led to Kobe having a hard time adjusting to a steady role and his situation was highlighted in the 1997 playoffs when he airballed
						conseuctive shots against the Utah Jazz. These setbacks would have mentally broken any other young player, but Kobe used this negative experience to fuel his work ethic even more for years to come.

						<h3>Personal Turbulence:</h3>
						<p style='color:blueviolet;'> Even after winning multiple championships and becoming one of the best players in the world, Kobe's life was far from perfect. During the early to mid 2000s, Kobe faced a lot of personal problems which also became legal battles. Nonetheless, he had to be a professional and continue to perform at a high level 
							on the court. The following video shows how Kobe transformed this personal chaos into a tool that served him as a player and helped him vent out his emotions in a productive way.

						<h3>The Shaq Breakup:</h3>
						<p style='color:blueviolet;'> After clashing with co-star Shaquille O'Neal for many years, the Lakers traded Shaq in 2004 and the media had labelled Kobe as the villain in the situation. Also, the team had gotten signficantly worse with Shaq gone, so Kobe was looked upon as a solo act who cannot impact winning. Once again, Kobe's ability and 
						character was being challenged, and he rose to the occassion. After the breakup with Shaq, Kobe would go on to play some of the best basketball of his career and show the world his full capabilities.
