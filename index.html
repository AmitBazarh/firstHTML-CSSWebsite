						<h3>Italy Life:</h3>
						<p style='color: blueviolet;'>Kobe Bryant had a very unique childhood. His father was a professional basketball player himself, which means that Kobe's family would have to relocate frequently. One of these 
							relocations was to Italy where a young Kobe faced a severe culture shock. By not knowing the language or having stable friendships, Kobe would confide in the game of basketball 
							and develop a sense of independency that would serve him for years to come.

						<h3>Philly Life:</h3>
						<p style='color:blueviolet;'>The last relocation that Kobe had to experience before his NBA career was when he was thirteen and his family moved back to Philadelphia. This where he faced more culture shock as a
						teenager. He got through this phase yet again by keeping his focus on basketball, which ultimately let to him emerging as one of the best high school players in the country. The following video offers some perspective
						about how his experiences throughout his upbringing helped him develop internal strength and maturity as he was transitioning into adult life.

						<h3>Early NBA life:</h3>
						<p style='color: blueviolet;'>After being drafted 13th overall straight out of Lower Merion High School, Kobe's path was set in stone to be a solitary one. Before the 2000s, it was very rare for a player to be drafted straight out of high school. That being said, Kobe was on a team full of
						much older players and yet again, felt out of place amongst. Also, he realized that many players don't share his level of commitment to the game, which strayed him further apart from being very social with his peers. The pattern of basketball being his one true friend was destined to continue.
